<h1>What is Machine Learning? Defination, Types, Applications, and more </h1>
<p>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It has become an increasingly popular topic in recent years due to the many practical applications it has in a variety of industries. In this blog, we will explore the basics of machine learning, delve into more advanced topics, and discuss how it is being used to solve real-world problems. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn about machine learning or an experienced data scientist seeking to stay up-to-date on the latest developments, we hope you will find something of interest here.</p>

<h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
<br>
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to enable computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It is predicated on the notion that computers can learn from data, spot patterns, and make judgments with little assistance from humans.
<br>
<br>
It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It is the study of making machines more human-like in their behavior and decisions by giving them the ability to learn and develop their own programs. This is done with minimum human intervention, i.e., no explicit programming. The learning process is automated and improved based on the experiences of the machines throughout the process.
<br>
<br>
Good quality data is fed to the machines, and different algorithms are used to build ML models to train the machines on this data. The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data at hand and the type of activity that needs to be automated. 
<br>
<br>
Now you may wonder, how is it different from traditional programming? Well, in traditional programming, we would feed the input data and a well-written and tested program into a machine to generate output. When it comes to machine learning, input data, along with the output, is fed into the machine during the learning phase, and it works out a program for itself. To understand this better, refer to the illustration below:

<h3>History of Machine Learning</h3>
<br>
This section discusses the development of machine learning over the years. Today we are witnessing some astounding applications like self-driving cars, natural language processing and facial recognition systems making use of ML techniques for their processing. All this began in the year 1943, when Warren McCulloch a neurophysiologist along with a mathematician named Walter Pitts authored a paper that threw a light on neurons and its working. They created a model with electrical circuits and thus neural network was born. 
<br>
<br>
The famous “Turing Test” was created in 1950 by Alan Turing, which would ascertain whether computers had real intelligence. It has to make a human believe that it is not a computer but a human instead, to get through the test. Arthur Samuel developed the first computer program that could learn as it played the game of checkers in the year 1952. The first neural network, called the perceptron was designed by Frank Rosenblatt in the year 1957. 
<br>
<br>
The big shift happened in the 1990s when machine learning moved from being knowledge-driven to a data-driven technique due to the availability of huge volumes of data. IBM’s Deep Blue, developed in 1997 was the first machine to defeat the world champion in the game of chess. Businesses have recognized that the potential for complex calculations could be increased through machine learning.  Some of the latest projects include: Google Brain, which was developed in 2012, was a deep neural network that focused on pattern recognition in images and videos. It was later employed to detect objects in YouTube videos. In 2014, Facebook created Deep Face, which can recognize people just like how humans do. In 2014, Deep Mind created a computer program called Alpha Go a board game that defeated a professional Go player. Due to its complexity, the game is said to be a very challenging yet classical game for artificial intelligence. Scientists Stephen Hawking and Stuart Russel have felt that if AI gains the power to redesign itself at an intensifying rate, then an unbeatable “intelligence explosion” may lead to human extinction. Musk characterizes AI as humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” Open AI is an organization created by Elon Musk in 2015 to develop safe and friendly AI that could benefit humanity. Recently, some of the breakthrough areas in AI are Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning.

<h3>How to get started with Machine Learning?</h3>
<br>
To get started, let’s take a look at some of the important terminologies.

<h3>Terminology:</h3>
#Model: Also known as “hypothesis”, a machine learning model is the mathematical representation of a real-world process. A machine learning algorithm along with the training data builds a machine learning model.
<br>
#Feature: A feature is a measurable property or parameter of the data-set.
<br>
#Feature Vector: It is a set of multiple numeric features. We use it as an input to the machine learning model for training and prediction purposes.
<br>
#Training: An algorithm takes a set of data known as “training data” as input. The learning algorithm finds patterns in the input data and trains the model for expected results (target). The output of the training process is the machine learning model.
<br>
#Prediction: Once the machine learning model is ready, it can be fed with input data to provide a predicted output.
<br>
#Target (Label): The value that the machine learning model has to predict is called the target or label.
<br>
#Overfitting: When a massive amount of data trains a machine learning model, it tends to learn from the noise and inaccurate data entries. Here the model fails to characterize the data correctly.
<br>
#Underfitting: It is the scenario when the model fails to decipher the underlying trend in the input data. It destroys the accuracy of the machine learning model. In simple terms, the model or the algorithm does not fit the data well enough.

It is mandatory to learn a programming language, preferably Python, along with the required analytical and mathematical knowledge. Here are the five mathematical areas that you need to brush up before jumping into solving Machine Learning problems:

1. Linear algebra for data analysis: Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors
